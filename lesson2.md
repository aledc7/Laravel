# Lesson 2

So, we have everything ready for start with our code.


```php
composer create-project laravel/laravel training-aledc "5.5.*"
```

In the command above, the last parameter "5.5. *" is optional, and is for indicate a specific version. I use this version because it is the same used in the documentation that I am using.
